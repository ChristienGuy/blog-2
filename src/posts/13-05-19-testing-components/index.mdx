excerpt: Writing tests can be tricky if you're not sure what you're testing

Unit testing ensures that each unit of code behaves as you expect. This means testing that a given set of inputs results in a given set of outputs.

With react components you have only 2 inputs:

1. Props from programmer
2. Interactions from user

And you have only 2 outputs

1. Elements on a page
2. Side Effects.

Testing anything else is basically duplicating the code you're writing.

Take a simple component that only outputs Elements

- More complex component that takes multiple Props

Do you need to mock to test a side effect. (probably easiest)

- Simple component with side effects.
