Tried a bunch of React Native some time ago.

I ran into some weird issues with performance and often real difficulties integrating with platform APIs (e.g notifications, background work).

I wanted to make a fairly simple app that made sense to be native since I wanted local notifications and offline persistance and performance that's tricky on the web (even with PWA's, Cache API etc.)
