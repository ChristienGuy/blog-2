## Copy to clipboard

Simple implementation:
* hidden input
* value of input and value displayed is the same
* grab ref to hidden input
* select text
* exec copy to clipboard
* set copy state

Problems with ios
* need to set contentEditable
* need to set readOnly false
* need to create a range
* need to add the node to the range
* need to set that range on the document
* need to set the selection range on that range/node
* now you can copy
