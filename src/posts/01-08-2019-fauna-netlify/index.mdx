excerpt: Every buzzword you can imagine.

Been working on a little side project, seemed relatively straightforward but I made it complicated with buzzwords.

Setup initially is actually quite straightforward thanks to hard work of grat people (netlify, fauna, sw-yx)

`create-react-app` for getting a quick project going.
`react-netlify-widget` for a quick startup of netlify identity.

`identity-signup` for a auto-registered webhook function on email confirmation.
Then some examples used to write the function, what the function does:

- Create a user in faunadb
- Create a faunadb token for that user (allows authenticated use later)

`faunadb` setup with token returned from identity (need to look into refreshing the token each session, e.g once we know that netlify has identified a user use that name and credential to go get a token)

`faunadb` graphql, schema, queries, roles, UDF for getting "me".
`netlify function` for proxying graphql queries
