I've been rebuilding this site/blog for a little while. Moving from [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) to [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/).

Hugo is absolutely excellent and I strongly encourage anyone to give it a try, but I personally prefer React as a UI framework and JSX as a templating language. Especially since it's what I spend most of my time at my day job using. So it made sense to re-write the blog using React, but it doesn't _really_ make sense to use for something like a blog that's not partocularly dynamic. Gatsby is a great static site generator and an excellent way to use React as a tool for component management and templating while maintaining speed and simplicity on the client.

That doesn't necessarily mean I'll only be writing about React (tho it'll probably be a lot of that). This is really just a platform to talk, mostly about web programming/platform stuff but possibly about a variety of other things. At the moment I've got a few projects underway: making my own keyboard, building a little thing to automatically performance test a website regularly, and making a little plant watering reminder. Those are what I've got so far but I'm sure more things will come along, they always do.
