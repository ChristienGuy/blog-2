Listening for a click outside of your component.

First we need to know _what_ your component is. Do this by passing it a ref.

```
const Tooltip = () => {
  const nodeRef = useRef();
  return (
    <span ref={nodeRef}>
      some info about your site.
    </span>
  )
}
```

Then you need to add a listener to the entire document and work out if the click happened within or without our component. This happens in the same way you would for vanilla JS.

```js
document.addEventListener('click', onDocumentClick)
```

Then we can flip some state based on that happening.

What about a nice hook to wrap all that up. Pass in a method to run, return a ref for use on the component to watch.

Check out the [source](https://github.com/ChristienGuy/react-click-away) of the finished hook.
