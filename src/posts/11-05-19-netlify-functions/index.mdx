## Usage

Most of my usage is wrapping up protected API's to avoid CORS issues and hide api-keys from users.

## Develop

Super simple setup with `netlify dev` and `create-react-app` for front end stuff.

example for movies database use, split endpoints into separate functions. Can extend single functions with additional functionality. e.g storing a response in firebase as a reference to a user.

## Deploy
